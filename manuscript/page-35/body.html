Fumigation with formaldehyde candles, although excellent for killing disease germs, is worthless for insect control, and the public is warned accordingly. Sulphur fumes will kill many carpet beetles, but very few persons succeed in killing all carpet beetles with sulphur fumes. Sulphur should be burned at the rate of 13� ounces per 1,000 cubic feet of space.
