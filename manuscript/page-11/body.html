very distinct from the true clothes moths. In this country there are
six species,[1] at least, that attack museum materials and household
fabrics, but of these only four[2] have proved serious household pests
in America. All species are capable of subsisting upon dried animal
remains, and thrive upon them perhaps as well as upon the fine fabrics
of wool, hair, feathers, fur, and silk.</p><p>[1] <em>Anthrenus scrophulariae</em> L., <em>A. museorum</em> L., <em>A. fasciatus</em>
