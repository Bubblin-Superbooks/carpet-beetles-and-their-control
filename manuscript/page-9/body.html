CARPET BEETLES AND THEIR CONTROL</pre><p>CARPET BEETLES, or so-called "buffalo moths," are common household
pests usually associated in their destructive work with clothes moths.
Ordinarily they are not so destructive as clothes moths, because they
reproduce only once a year, and then not so abundantly.</p><p>Experienced housewives throughout the North are familiar with the
stout, oval, reddish-brown, hairy grubs or larv√¶ of the common carpet
beetle, found beneath carpets or in clothing. In southern homes,
however, the longer, slender, golden-brown larva of the black carpet
beetle, with its tuft of golden bristles, is more common.</p></div> </div>
