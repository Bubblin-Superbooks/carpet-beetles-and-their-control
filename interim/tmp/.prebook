The beetles are broadly oval and about three-sixteenths to one-fourth of an inch long; black, but with this blackness often obscured by tiny red, orange, brown, yellow, or white scales which form color designs characteristic of the species. These scales, which are modified hairs, are easily rubbed off, revealing the black color of the body beneath. The larvæ, or grubs (as the larvæ of beetles are often called) are brownish or black and variously clothed with stiff hairs, as shown in Figures <a>1</a> and <a>8</a>, or with a long tuft of hairs at the end of the body, as shown in <a>Figure 5</a>. Carpet beetles pass through not more than two generations annually, and more often only one, and there are records of certain individuals requiring much longer, even three years, to complete their growth.

It also has a red stripe down the middle of the back, widening into projections at three intervals. When disturbed it \"plays 'possum,\" folding up its legs and antennæ and feigning death As a general thing the beetles begin to appear in the fall, and continue to issue, in heated houses, throughout the winter and following spring. Soon after issuing they pair, and the females lay their eggs in convenient spots. The eggs hatch, under favorable conditions, in a few days, and the larvæ, with plenty of food, develop quite rapidly. Their development is retarded by cold weather or lack of food, and they remain alive in the larval state, in such conditions and particularly in a dry atmosphere, for an almost indefinite period molting frequently and feeding upon their cast skins. Under normal conditions, however the skin is cast about six times, and there are, probably, in the North, not more than two annual generations. When the larva reaches full growth the yellowish pupa is formed within the last larval skin. Eventually this skin splits down the back and reveals the pupa, from which the beetle emerges later. The beetles are day fliers, and when not engaged in egg laying are attracted to the light. They fly to the windows, and may often be found upon the sills or panes. Where they can fly out through an open window they do so, and are strongly attracted to the flowers of certain plants, particularly the family Scrophulariaceæ but also to certain Composite, such as milfoil (<em>Achillea millefolium</em>). The flowers of Spiræa are also strongly attractive to the beetles. It is probable, however, that this migration from the house takes place, under ordinary circumstances after the eggs have been laid."

Fumigation with formaldehyde candles, although excellent for killing disease germs, is worthless for insect control, and the public is warned accordingly. Sulphur fumes will kill many carpet beetles, but very few persons succeed in killing all carpet beetles with sulphur fumes. Sulphur should be burned at the rate of 13� ounces per 1,000 cubic feet of space. It is likely to bleach wall paper and fine fabrics and tarnish metals, and should never be used unless one is aware of these possible bad results."

    "innerHtml": "<b>Hydrocyanic-acid gas.</b>—Hydrocyanic-acid gas is the best gas known and in present use for the fumigation of houses, or parts of houses, for the speedy elimination of carpet beetles or other pests. When persons are troubled with fabric pests that have become generally established throughout the house, nothing will give greater satisfaction in peace of mind and freedom from trouble than one thorough fumigation carried on by a professional fumigator or by any intelligent, careful person capable of following directions. Hydrocyanic-acid gas is dangerous to human beings, but is noninflammable and nonexplosive as used in household fumigation as here advocated. It is lighter than air, will injure no fabric or painting, and will not tarnish household metals. If properly used, it is one of the simplest and best methods of fighting house pests. Interested persons can have full particulars free of cost by writing the Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, for Farmers' Bulletin 699."

    "innerHtml": "<b>Carbon disulphid.</b>—Carbon disulphid is a fumigant in general use for killing insects of all sorts in containers that are reasonably tight. It is excellent for killing carpet beetles in chests, trunks, and closets that can be closed and sealed. It has been used for the fumigation of entire buildings when these are detached. It is purchased at drug stores or of chemical firms as a liquid put up in tin cans containing 1, 2, 5, or 10 pounds each. Upon exposure to the air, the liquid evaporates, forming a gas heavier than air which sinks through the container being fumigated and kills the insects by suffocation. The gas is explosive in the presence of fire, and must be handled with the same care as gasoline or benzine. Although the liquid as purchased is considered not explosive or inflammable, great care should be exercised in storing and handling it since it is almost impossible to dissociate it from its gas, which is, as stated above, decidedly explosive and inflammable in the presence of fire. The odor of carbon disulphid gas is very disagreeable, but soon disappears with the airing of the container after fumigation. Carbon disulphid fumigation is excellent for the destruction of carpet beetles in articles that can be stored in trunks, chests, or closets, or for killing pests in pianos and upholstered furniture that can be placed in a small room for the period of fumigation. Full particulars regarding this fumigant and the ease with which it can be used may be had by writing the Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, for Farmers' Bulletin 799."

Carbon tetrachlorid is not a particularly effective fumigant, but it has the advantage of producing, upon evaporation, a gas that is noninflammable and nonexplosive, and for this reason can be used in certain places where lighted lamps, fires, etc., can not be entirely eliminated. See Farmers' Bulletin 799 for reference to use of carbon tetrachlorid and carbon disulphid."

    "innerHtml": "<b>Laundering and dry cleaning.</b>—When material infested with carpet beetles is submerged in a solution of 1 pound of neutral soap to 10 gallons of water all stages of the beetles are killed. Carpet-beetle larvæ are killed if subjected to temperatures of 120, 125, and 128° F. for 30, 15, and 10 minutes, respectively. Eggs are killed when subjected to temperatures of 125 and 130° F. for 16 and 11 minutes, respectively Eggs and larvæ were killed in material dipped for 5 second in water at 140° F., but submergence for the same period in water at a temperature of 122° F. failed to kill all of them. Translated into household terms this means that laundering clothing or other textiles in thick suds or with water hotter than the hand can bear, or pressing with a hot iron, will probably kill the larvæ and eggs of the carpet beetle. The usual commercial dry-cleaning processes also are probably effective. Unfortunately these methods are not always easily applied to the articles most likely to be infested; they must not be considered a preventive against reinfestation."

    "innerHtml": "<b>Treatment of floor cracks and other hiding places.</b>—Carpet-beetle larvæ often secrete themselves in the cracks of flooring, beneath base boards, and in other openings about houses formed by the usual shrinking or settling of woodwork. The larvæ feed upon the lint which gathers in such places. It is, therefore, an excellent procedure to have all such openings closed where possible by filling in with putty or patented crack-fillers. Any cracks that can not be filled in this manner should be periodically filled with gasoline, kerosene, or benzine to kill larvæ. Since these liquids are inflammable, care must be exercised not to have lighted lamps or fire in any form about until after the rooms are well ventilated."
