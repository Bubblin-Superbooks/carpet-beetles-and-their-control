Fumigation with formaldehyde candles,\nalthough excellent for killing disease germs, is worthless for insect\ncontrol, and the public is warned accordingly. Sulphur fumes will kill\nmany carpet beetles, but very few persons succeed in killing all carpet\nbeetles with sulphur fumes. Sulphur should be burned at the rate of 13½\nounces per 1,000 cubic feet of space. It is likely to bleach wall paper\nand fine fabrics and tarnish metals, and should never be used unless\none is aware of these possible bad results.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\"><strong>Hydrocyanic-acid gas.</strong>--Hydrocyanic-acid gas is the best gas known and\nin present use for the fumigation of</p>",

When persons\nare troubled with fabric pests that have become generally established\nthroughout the house, nothing will give greater satisfaction in peace\nof mind and freedom from trouble than one thorough fumigation carried\non by a professional fumigator or by any intelligent, careful person\ncapable of following directions. Hydrocyanic-acid gas is dangerous\nto human beings, but is noninflammable and nonexplosive as used in\nhousehold fumigation as here advocated. It is lighter than air, will\ninjure no fabric or painting, and will not tarnish household metals. If\nproperly used, it is one of the simplest and best methods of fighting\nhouse pests.

It is excellent for killing carpet beetles in chests, trunks,\nand closets that can be closed and sealed. It has been used for the\nfumigation of entire buildings when these are detached. It is purchased\nat drug stores or of chemical firms as a liquid put up in tin cans\ncontaining 1, 2, 5, or 10 pounds each. Upon exposure to the air, the\nliquid evaporates, forming a gas heavier than air which sinks through\nthe container being fumigated and kills the insects by suffocation.\nThe gas is explosive in the presence of fire, and must be handled with\nthe same care as gasoline or benzine. Although the liquid as purchased\nis considered not explosive or inflammable, great care should be\nexercised in storing and handling it since it is almost impossible\nto dissociate it from its gas, which is, as stated above, decidedly\nexplosive and inflammable in the presence of fire.
