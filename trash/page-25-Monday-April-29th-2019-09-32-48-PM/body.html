The beetles often fly in large numbers rather high above the ground.

The writer observed two adults fly into his city apartment in Washington through an open window during early March, 1922. These flights of adults are of extreme importance to the householder, because they emphasize how readily carpet beetles may spread from house to house during spring and early summer. Window screens will exclude all except the smallest specimens if they fit tightly, but the average removable screen does not fit tightly enough to prevent adult carpet beetles from crawling into the house between screen and window frame.</p></div> </div>
